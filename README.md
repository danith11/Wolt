# Food Delivery Dispatch Simulation Case Study

This is a simulation-based case study for a "Wolt" food delivery dispatch system, built in Python using the `simpy` library. The simulation models the flow of orders from restaurants to customers and analyzes how the number of available drivers impacts system performance.

## How to Run

### 1. Requirements
* Python 3.12.6
* `simpy`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
